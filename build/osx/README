The recommended way to build Gimp for Mac OS X is using jhbuild, configured with a base module set maintained in gtk-osx.

General documentation on building GTK+ for OS X:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK+/OSX/Building


Environment:

Beware that MacPorts, Homebrew etc may interfere with the jhbuild environment. Keep these out of your shell environment when building with jhbuild.

Also avoid having directories with spaces in your PATH; this can cause build failures in some modules.


First steps:

  $ curl -O https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
  $ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

This will fetch the current version of jhbuild with the gtk-osx module sets, installing jhbuild into ~/.local/ -- so make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH for later.

If using the 10.9 SDK, note that Apple has dropped python from the SDK copy of the libraries as they now discourage linking against the system python. You'll have to enable a local python build; edit .jhbuildrc-custom and uncomment this line:

  # _gtk_osx_use_jhbuild_python = True


Now, bootstrap the gtk-osx stuff...

  $ jhbuild bootstrap
  $ jhbuild build python # explicit since it's not in the deps
  $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap
  $ jhbuild build

Get a coffee, this will take a while.


[need to get updated versions of the gimp module files from old stable branch]


[need to figure out the app bundling]
